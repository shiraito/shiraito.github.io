## Abstract
Political scientists have examined which characteristics of electoral candidates are preferred by voters, commonly using conjoint survey designs where candidates' characteristics are randomized. In these experimental studies, survey respondents tend to prefer young and female hypothetical candidates. However, young and female candidates are substantially less likely to hold political offices. In this study, we focus on the case of Japan, where gender and age disparities among politicians are large, to disentangle the reasons for the discrepancy between experimental evidence and real-world elections. Employing a conjoint survey experiment conducted immediately after the July 2022 Upper House elections, we compare respondents' choices in the experiment with their self-reported voting behavior in the actual election. Our analysis reveals that while voting in the actual election aligns with preferences on most candidate characteristics shown in the experiment, real-world incumbent candidates have a much greater advantage than the conjoint estimate suggests. This implies that gender and age disparities among politicians persist because voters have a strong preference for incumbents, even though they are predominantly male and older.
