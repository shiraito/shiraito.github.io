## Abstract
Evolutionary societal changes often prompt a debate.
The positions of the two major political parties in the United States on civil rights issues underwent a reversal in the 20th century.
The conventional view holds that this shift was a structural break in the 1960s, driven by party elites, while recent studies argue that the change was a more gradual process that began as early as the 1930s, driven by local rank-and-file party members.
Motivated by this controversy, this paper develops a nonparametric Bayesian model that incorporates a hidden Markov model into the Dirichlet process mixture model.
A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that it models a process in which multiple latent clusters emerge and diminish as a continuing process so that it uncovers any of steady, sudden, and repeated shifts in analyzing longitudinal data.
Our model estimates each partyâ€™s positions on civil rights in each state based on the legislative activities of their Congressional members, identifying cross- and within-party coalitions over time.
We find evidence of gradual racial realignment in the 20th century, with two periods of fast changes during the 1948 election and the Civil Rights Movement.
