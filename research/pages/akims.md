## Abstract
Multi-party elections are the core institution in representative politics, transforming relationships between politicians and citizens. However, few political science studies have explored how the introduction of elections influences public perceptions of politicians. Answering this question is challenging because the decision to hold the first elections is endogenous to various factors, and all citizens are exposed to electoral processes during national elections. To identify the causal effects of first-ever elections, we analyze the staggered implementation of village elections after past turnovers of appointed village chiefs in Kazakhstan. Using item counts, conjoint analysis, and anchoring vignettes to measure political attitudes in autocratic contexts, we find that those who participate in their first election express higher levels of political efficacy but report more frequent experiences of bribing local officials. Our conjoint experiment indicates that people neither punish nor reward elected village leaders based on policy responsiveness. Overall, our results suggest that first elections in representative institutions, despite fraud, may encourage citizens to engage in politics but do not significantly affect their evaluations of leadership. Furthermore, these elections may foster negative sentiments toward the quality of government.
