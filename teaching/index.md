## POLSCI 599: Statistical Methods in Political Research I

This is the first course to provide the foundation in statistics that students will need in
the Political Science graduate methods sequence. Topics covered include probability theory,
sampling distributions, sampling theory, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and strategies
of data analysis. The course assumes students has taken Political Science Math Camp or
equivalent. A previous background in statistics is desirable but not required for taking the
course.

## POLSCI 798: Advanced Topics in Quantitative Methodology

This course is designed to introduce students to modern Bayesian data analysis with em-
phasis on applications in social sciences. While the course is largely an applied course, it is
intended to provide modeling and computational tools to its students so that they will be able
to develop new applied models for analyzing original data in future research. Topics covered
include Bayesian regression models, item response theory models, topic models, sampling meth-
ods, approximate Bayesian inference, and Bayesian nonparametrics. Prerequisites are POLSCI
599 and 699, or familiarity with basic mathematical statistics and regression analysis equivalent
to these courses.
